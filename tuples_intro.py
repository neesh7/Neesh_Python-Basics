# A tuple is a Mathematical name for an ordered set of data.
t = "a", "b", "c"
print(t)
print("_"*53)
# We see our output just appeared like a List But With a Parenthesis () .
# All common Sequence operations can be performed over Tuple.
tup = ("a", "b", "c")
print(tup)
# It Appears our output is same so in order to avoid confusion we will be using () Most of Time

print("My Name is",name,"And My age is {}".format(x), "And i am born in",1996)
# print function allows us to pass multiple arguments
# By using (()) "Double Parentheses" We can Pass Tuple to print
# As for example
print("_"*67)
